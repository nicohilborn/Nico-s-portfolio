My webpage's purpose is a portfolio where all my photos and drawings go after finishing them. 

The design choices i made were just making the website clean and simple, the color palette just being different shades of blue and the typography is just the franklin gothic font, layout is clean and simple. 

the challenges i faced were the images not showing up (cause of misspellings) and the animated part of the animation page having to change from an mp4 file to a gif.
